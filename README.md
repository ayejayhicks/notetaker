# Note Taker

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to create an application, Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.


## Description
Using Express.js I was tasked with building the back end of an application, connecting the front end and deploying the final application through Heroku.

## Challenges and Successes
Getting started is always an uphill battle. Although we were given the starter code for the front end I still needed to get a grasp on what was to come next. I combed through many past activities to refresh my memory on things that we have learned over the past week. Last week I was tasked with taking the homework in steps, following through on one task until completion and then continuing to build upon that. I find this to be a much better method so I don't become overwhelmed. Understanding the basic steps and continuing to build was vital for this homework. This was also the first time that I have worked with Heroku to deploy an application. On the last activity I struggled with node_modules being uploaded to my Github although a .gitignore was created. With this homework I decided to create the file, add the node_modules and make sure this was done prior to my first push which was proven to be successful.
